# MovieScript-WebScraping

To sum it up, I wanted to get some movie scripts for some movies but nooooo wayyyy was I going to just download html pages or copy the text from each page to notepad.

so I just wrote this script that downloads the text needed and writes it to a file (text is specifically from a website called www.imsdb.com - important to mention since the script depends on specific html tags being present)
